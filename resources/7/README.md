#### Weight Response Speed And Auto Turn-Off
Press and hold the HOLD & POWER button. Wait for the 5 second countdown to complete. You will begin in Weight Respone Speed settings. Press MODE to cycle between the following options, nb0 (longest) nb1 (intermediate) nb2 (fastest). Press TARE to select an option. I left mine at the default nb0 as I want accurate readings. Once we've selected the Weight Response Speed we are put in the Auto Turn-Off settings. The default is OFF 1 (2 minutes), OFF 2 (5 minutes), OFF 0 (Disabled as in the scale will stay on forever or till the batteries die or AC adapter is unplugged, or if you're nice, you turn off the power).
